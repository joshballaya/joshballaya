Hey y'all! I'm @joshballaya! Louisiana boy, techie, and aspiring tabletop game designer.
I've spent the last couple of years working on web applications as a consultant, but my heart is with data. 
The projects on this page will chronicle my journey breaking into a role as a data engineer/scientist/whatever. 

My big non-tech project right now _Coalition: Councils of the Republic_, a social negotiation game for 6-20 players about the shifting alliances of a medieval city-state.
You can follow its development here: https://sidereal.games/coalition/
